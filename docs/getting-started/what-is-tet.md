# What is TET?

TET, short for The Eco-friendly Technology, represents a paradigm shift in modern software development. It's a platform that empowers developers to create robust and efficient applications while minimizing environmental impact.

At its core, TET streamlines the development process by automating the generation of optimized C++ code. This means you can focus on designing innovative solutions rather than getting bogged down in repetitive coding tasks. The result? Faster development cycles and higher-quality applications.

With TET, you're not just using a coding platform; you're embracing a new way of approaching software development that puts efficiency, innovation, and environmental responsibility at the forefront.
